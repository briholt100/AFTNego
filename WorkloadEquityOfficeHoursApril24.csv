132	Support	I oppose any additional duties	Making an appeal to the law not increasing pay with out increasing duties does not make sense to me. What about the instructors in the state who are doing the same amount of work and getting paid more than ESL/ABE instructors?  Where is the law that says we should be paid the same amount as those who are doing the same work and getting paid more than us?  It sounds like it should be more about changing the category of how we are getting paid to match (or make equitable) that of other instructors at college level. 	ABE	18-20 hour	North
24	Oppose	I oppose any additional duties	"Although it would be slower, I support the legislative approach.  I feel like the ""(...electronic)office hours "" would be honored only in the breach and create a kind of hypocritic ""They're messing with us, so we'll mess with them by saying that we have electronic office hours when in fact we do nothing except grade papers once we leave campus.""  And requiring tutoring or  ??Educational interviews??  sounds a lot like more work to me (and who's going to keep track?) Which is what they want.  The current system may be unfair compared to other departments, but at least it's unambiguous.   "	ABE-ESL	18-20 hour	North
123	Oppose	I oppose any additional duties	"The main problem with this ""solution"" is that it does nothing to make progress on workload equity. Increasing pay by increasing workload doesn't affect workload inequity in even the slightest way. ABE/ESL part-time faculty will still be working more per dollar than everyone else. This solution does offer ABE/ESL part-time faculty an opportunity to make more money, but let’s not kid ourselves that inequity is being addressed.
This is like saying we’re going to improve the Seattle traffic problem by widening I-5 and adding more cars! Yes, a change will be made. Yes, more cars will pass through Seattle. But has the traffic problem been addressed? No, it hasn’t.
And as for the “con” that this proposal “Creates disparity between part-time faculty groups,” disparity already exists between part-time faculty groups; that’s why this proposal is even being made in the first place.

My understanding was that we're not asking for a pay increase per se, but rather a reduction in what is considered a full time load in ABE/ESL to match that of other departments without a reduction in pay. Am I talking about the wrong issue, or does somebody else misunderstand the reason for our discontent?  On the other hand, is this ""raising pay"" proposal intended as an interim measure for pushing through State legislation (if that's needed) to equalize our hours?  If so, would that work?

1) the offices provided to part time faculty are often not the best spaces, I have never found I can get much done in the windowless closets we are typically afforded, and I choose to do most of my work from home as a result
2) in my 4 years of teaching, I have NEVER had a student come to office hours. Making an appointment to meet with me at a particular time, yes, popping in unplanned to generic office hours, never. Sitting in an office, not doing work, waiting for students who don't show up is a huge waste of time for me. (but again, ABE/ESL might be different)
3) As part-time faculty, I teach at multiple institutions, often meaning I have to come to campus, teach my class, and then immediately jet off somewhere else. Having regular office hours in addition to class time would often necessitate commuting back to the campus a second time in the day, or holding office hours at really inconvenient times for both me and the students."
